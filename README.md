WhackAMole
==========

The program tries to locate a camera 

and then shows you a camera feed overlaid with either a mole 
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aleph-one/WhackAMole/master/mole-medium.png"/> 
or a squirrel 
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aleph-one/WhackAMole/master/squirrel-medium.png"/>.

Try to hit the mole (and not the squirrel) with something RED.
